"""Feature engineering agent — transforms validated data into model-ready features.

This agent receives the validated DataFrame, EDA profile, and target
detection results from the workflow state and produces model-ready
features:

1. Handles remaining nulls (fill or flag — distinct from ETL's drop).
2. Encodes categoricals excluding the target column.
3. Scales numeric features (min-max, excluding the target).
4. Detects and flags outliers (IQR-based, flag by default).
5. Selects features via variance threshold and correlation-with-target.

Distinction from ETL (``agents/etl``):
- ETL runs *before* target detection and operates on ALL columns.
  Its job is to produce a clean DataFrame by dropping nulls and
  encoding every categorical.
- Feature Engineering runs *after* target detection.  It knows which
  column is the target and excludes it from all transforms.  It adds
  signal (scaling, outlier detection, feature selection) on top of
  ETL's clean base.

Design:
- Stateless: all inputs come from ``WorkflowState``.
- Engine-mediated: all data operations go through ``BaseEngine`` —
  no direct pandas/polars imports.
- Thin orchestrator: delegates to ``ml.feature_engineering.engineer``
  for real engineering logic.
- Returns: dict with ``features`` and ``feature_names``
  that LangGraph merges into the workflow state.
